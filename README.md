Getting ready for a machine learning interview at a big tech company or startup? It can feel overwhelming with all the different rounds, from testing your broad knowledge to diving deep into specific problems, system design, and coding challenges. When I first started, I felt completely lost and had to dig deep to piece together the right resources.

That’s why I’m writing this article — to share the resources that helped me, so you don’t have to struggle through the similar confusion and can confidently navigate your Machine Learning interviews.

Note: This article won’t cover general software engineering interview rounds like DSA coding or specialized roles like Data Analyst, where the focus is on SQL or data-specific questions.

Let’s get started.
