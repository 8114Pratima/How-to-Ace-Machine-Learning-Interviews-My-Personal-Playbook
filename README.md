Getting ready for a machine learning interview at a big tech company or startup? It can feel overwhelming with all the different rounds, from testing your broad knowledge to diving deep into specific problems, system design, and coding challenges. When I first started, I felt completely lost and had to dig deep to piece together the right resources.

That’s why I’m writing this article — to share the resources that helped me, so you don’t have to struggle through the similar confusion and can confidently navigate your Machine Learning interviews.

Note: This article won’t cover general software engineering interview rounds like DSA coding or specialized roles like Data Analyst, where the focus is on SQL or data-specific questions.

The Four Types of Rounds:

📚 Machine Learning Breadth: This round tests your broad knowledge across various ML topics. I usually spend about 35% of my prep time here.
🔍 Machine Learning Depth: This round requires about 25% of my prep time, focusing on specialized topics and detailed case studies.
🛠️ Machine Learning System Design: This round evaluates your ability to design scalable ML systems. I allocate around 40% of my prep time here.
💻 Machine Learning Coding: In this round, you’ll tackle coding challenges around basic algorithms. Since this round is generally rare, I dedicate about 0–10% of my prep time (shared with Breadth).

Note: This breakdown will vary depending on your experience level and background. Adapt your preparation strategy to best fit your needs.

📚 Machine Learning Breadth
This round assesses an engineer’s understanding of ML fundamentals across various topics. It’s often a rapid-fire session where interviewers may jump between different topics or might ask general questions within an area.

A common mistake is relying solely on online questionnaires. Interviewers often reframe questions, making it essential to understand concepts deeply. For example, I was once asked how to handle imbalanced classes in a user-click dataset (where one class, like user click, is much less common than the other class). I suggested “oversampling,” which can distort the dataset distribution and affect the model’s accuracy. Instead, with a large dataset, it’s better not to change the data distribution.

Topics vary by company. For instance, self-driving car companies may ask computer vision fundamentals for junior or senior roles, while other companies might focus on general ML fundamentals.

Fundamental Topics (All Levels)
Supervised Learning: Classification (Logistic Regression, SVMs, Decision Trees), Regression (Linear and Ridge regression)
Unsupervised Learning: Clustering (k-means, hierarchical, DBSCAN), Dimensionality Reduction, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
Ensemble Methods: Random Forest (Bagging), Gradient Boosting Machines
Deep Learning: Multi-layer Perceptron, CNNs
Model Evaluation Metrics: Classification vs Regression evaluation metrics, Bias vs Variance Tradeoff
Loss Functions: Different types of loss functions, Regularization, Overfitting vs Underfitting
Feature Selection and Importance: Techniques to identify important features like Correlation analysis, recursive feature elimination, Lasso
Statistics: P-values, r-square, regression analysis, Naive Bayes, distributions, maximum likelihood estimation, A/B testing

🔍 Machine Learning Depth
This round is particularly interesting and the most open-ended of all interview types. It is generally aimed for above entry-level jobs with some experience. The goal of this interview is threefold:

Theoretical and practical understanding of a specific problem space
Designing a valid experiment and analyzing results
Communication skills
Expect interviewers to have a significant background knowledge in this area. While it’s challenging to prepare specifically for this round, understanding the general directions it can take can be helpful. Here are some common directions this interview can take:

Past Experience: Discussing your academic or industrial projects and their shortcomings. Be prepared to discuss your projects in detail.
Theoretical Background: Delves into the theoretical aspects of a specialized field, especially if the role requires such specialization.

🛠️ Machine Learning System Design
This round resembles a typical software engineering system design interview, applying similar principles. You are given a product space (e.g., designing a YouTube recommendation ML system) and asked to define the problem, outline the design process, and communicate your thoughts, including tradeoffs.

Interviewers look for your problem-solving approach, thought process, and high-level design skills. During the interview, you may be asked to dive deeper into specific components. Generally most ML systems can be broken down into 5 critical components. Here’s main focus of each component:

1️⃣ Problem Definition

Clearly define the problem and formulate your hypothesis.
2️⃣ Evaluation Metrics

Understand the difference between model performance metrics and business metrics.
Model Metrics: Precision, Recall, MSE, etc.
Business Metrics: Revenue, number of clicks, number of frauds detected, etc.
3️⃣ Feature and Data

Handle offline and real-time data streaming pipelines and preprocess raw data to create features.
4️⃣ Model Development

Training:

Select appropriate models and discuss your rationale behind model choices. Provide details on the training process (one-time vs. recurrent vs. online training).
Evaluation:

Choose evaluation datasets and effectively evaluate model performance.
5️⃣ Inference Service and Deployment

Develop a deployment strategy, including the choice of technologies and ensuring the scalability of the inference service. Discuss your approach for automated deployment, evaluation, and A/B testing.

💻 Machine Learning Coding
I’ve only encountered a Machine Learning-specific coding round once. This round is uncommon but more frequently seen in startups. Unless it’s explicitly mentioned, I don’t typically prepare for it. Always confirm with your recruiter if there will be ML coding questions in any of the rounds. If not, focus your preparation on other sections. If there is a specific ML coding round, reallocate some time from ML breadth to practice coding for a few days. The strategy is simple: merge your ML coding preparation with the fundamentals in ML breadth, practicing coding for basic models.
